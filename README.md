## **Introduction**

Access to agricultural finance is a critical component in empowering farmers, yet many face challenges in securing loans due to lack of clarity on eligibility. This project addresses the issue by using a **machine learning model** to predict whether a farmer is eligible for a loan based on parameters like income, credit score, crop type, yield, and farm size.

---

## **Features**

- Predicts whether a farmer is **eligible or not eligible** for a loan.
- User-friendly web interface to input details like income, debt, credit score, crop type, and more.
- Covers important parameters: **Loan Amount, Annual Income, Credit Score, Farm Size, Yield per Acre, Market Prices**, etc.
- Built using a **Random Forest Classifier** for robust prediction.
- Responsive web app with clean UI for both mobile and desktop use.

---

## **Dataset**

The model is trained on a synthetically generated dataset based on domain knowledge and loan eligibility standards in the agricultural sector. This dataset includes financial, personal, and agricultural attributes to mimic real-world farmer data.

> *(Note: Dataset can be customized or improved with real-world data from institutions or open data platforms.)*

## **Technology Used**

- Python
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend Design)
- Bootstrap and FontAwesome (for responsive UI)

2. Fill in the form with your agricultural and financial details.
3. Click “Predict” to see whether you're eligible for a loan.
4. The model will return results as either **"Eligible"** or **"Not Eligible"**.
