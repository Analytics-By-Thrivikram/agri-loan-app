Agri Loan Eligibility Prediction Web Application
This project is submitted by Thrivikram Sai Teja Padala as part of a learning initiative to apply data analytics and machine learning for practical problem-solving. The goal of this project is to assist farmers in determining their eligibility for agricultural loans using predictive modeling techniques.

Introduction
Access to agricultural finance is a critical component in empowering farmers, yet many face challenges in securing loans due to lack of clarity on eligibility. This project addresses the issue by using a machine learning model to predict whether a farmer is eligible for a loan based on parameters like income, credit score, crop type, yield, and farm size.
